# CadenceCalculator

This is quick and dirty VB.Net based utility, I wrote to measure cadence when analyzing running videos.  Majority of the web video players such as Youtube doesn't show time beyond seconds resolution.  That rules out measuring cadence using the video's play timer.  

This utility works by manually tapping any key on the keyboard.  Tap any key in sync with runner's left or right foot.   That shoudl show the cadence.   

Please see the code for further information.  Executable binary is also available for download in the bin/Release folder.
